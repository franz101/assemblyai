# Pitch Notes

* Problem - individual creator is very busy, writing is slow
* Need written tutorials
* Want students to be able to copy snippets of code as it is written, not just provide a repo
* Want to extract screenshots
* Website + integration with marketing + creator tools
* Multiple formats and languages
